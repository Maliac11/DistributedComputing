    - Really not all that sure what I'm doing. 
    - Planning to go after an OO-looking architecture, so a clock will be an object. 
    - OK, not sure what type of communication I want between these clocks. How about a socket between each pair of models? Initialized after the models... (Spent some time looking at other solutions like ZMQ, can't find anything perfect)
